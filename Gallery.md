These are my cats, I have two Cornish Rex cats (Comet and Galaxy) and the other cat is Martini. We use to show Comet and Galaxy in shows but both of them are retired. During there show years they were both champions. Comet was to shy so we retired him early but Galaxy went on to be a northeast short hair champion and has won many ribbons. Martini's job is to keep the chipmunk and squirrels from eating all the bird food. But during the long winter she has got fat and is no longer good at her job.
