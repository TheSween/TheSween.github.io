This is my senior year so I am doing my best to get all my work done. This is the most important year of high school and I need to get all my PLPâ€™s done and passed in. Keeping up in all my classes and in Voc. My goal by the end of the school year is to be A+ certified.

This is important because A+ is the entry level certification into the technology industry. I tend to slack on my work so staying on top of the game this year and getting my work done will help me achieve this.
