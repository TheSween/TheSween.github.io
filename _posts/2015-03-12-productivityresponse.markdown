When coding you will run into a log of error reports and be able to analyze the error code and solve the problem. May times this can be something as simple as a type or a indent where there isn't suppose to be one. One problem I ran into a lot was indenting when learning Python. Python is very picky about how it is indenting and if you indent wrong it will crash your whole code.  

Critical Thinking and Problem Solving is an important skill I have obtained. Being able to critically think and solve issues with computer system is important in the technology field. Computers always have issues if its hardware or software.
