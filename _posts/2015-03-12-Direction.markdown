I have accomplished many things due to my ability to direct my attention on stuff I wanted to achieve or learn. One of my biggest changes that took a lot of work and still requires a lot of work was losing weight. I set goals to help me accomplish this task. I use to weigh myself to see how my progress was going. At first this worked fine but later down the road I would get discouraged. I had went from 260 lbs to 220 lbs, then I started to gain weight. I was confused at first so I did what I always do when something is bothering me. I researched it and found out I was indeed gain weight. I was building more muscle and muscle weighs more than fat. This was when I decided to stop looking at a scale but use a mirror instead to focus on muscle groups that were lacking in size. I use the mirror more as a friend now then the enemy it was a couple years ago. 

This is important for my life after high school because it showed me that if I set goal and work hard at them I can achieve them. This boosted my confidence and showed me that if you want something and you want it right you need to set goals and achieve it. This is important in any job as where some projects might be to big to tackle at once so you break them up into little pieces and tackle those pieces.
