In my computer repair and networking class at Westbrook vocational center I helped a lot of my fellow classmates with problems they had. I have taken computer repair classes at Bonny Eagle with Mr.Cormier. I had prior knowledge in computer repair that I used to guide fellow students when they were stuck with problems.
