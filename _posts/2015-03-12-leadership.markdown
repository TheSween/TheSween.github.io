In my computer repair and networking class at Westbrook vocational center I helped a lot of my fellow classmates with problems they had. I have taken computer repair classes at Bonny Eagle with Mr.Cormier. I had prior knowledge in computer repair that I used to guide fellow students when they were stuck with problems.

It's important to be able to put your foot down and take charge when others can benefit from what you have to offer. Sometimes peers learn better from each other then adults or teachers.
