Environmental issues are a big problem not just in America but around the world. Thousands of cars burn fossil fuels and release nitrogen oxide which destroys the ozone at a faster rate then it can repair itself. Winds coming up the east coast can carry air pollution from New York all the way up here to Maine polluting our air. I believe tesla and their electric cars is a good way to stop the usage of fossil fuels.
