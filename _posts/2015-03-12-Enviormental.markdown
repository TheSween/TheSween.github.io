Environmental issues are a big problem not just in America but around the world. Thousands of cars burn fossil fuels and release nitrogen oxide which destroys the ozone at a faster rate than it can repair itself. Winds coming up the east coast can carry air pollution from New York all the way up here to Maine polluting our air. I believe Tesla and their electric cars is a good way to stop the usage of fossil fuels.  

This will not only effect me after high school but every one who lives on earth. If we destroy our home we will have no place to live. I got a new car recently and my mother wanted me to get a truck but I decided on a Doge Dart. It gets good gas MPG and still is a fun car to drive.
