Never before have we ever had this much access to as much media as we do today. In the last thirty years alone media has exploded. Back in 80’s hard wired telephones, newspapers, magazines, television, and radio. Fast forward 10 years and you have the beginning to cell phones but they didn’t quite have texting or any apps yet just for calls. The internet would shortly be coming up in 1992. Then fast forward ten more year to the 2000’s where facebook hasn't even been released yet. Let alone myspace wasn’t even around. Now fast forward to the world we live in today no matter what you are doing or where you are media is affecting you if you know it or not.

Knowing the importance of media and how to extract information you need from it is a great skill. Also knowing about copyright laws is important so you don't steal peoples work and get in trouble.
