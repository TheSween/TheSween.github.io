The internet and news are great ways to stay informed about our community. As I am the age of 18 I can now legally vote and will be voting in upcoming elections. Such as the 2016 presidential election. I have written a letter to our superintendent about the MLTI laptops that the school gets I suggested that instead of paying for laptops that had much more power than we would use. I suggest that we get chromebooks because they're cheap and they are optimized for google drive.
