The internet and news are great ways to stay informed about our community. As I am the age of 18 I can now legally vote and will be voting in upcoming elections. Such as the 2016 presidential election. I have written a letter to our superintendent about the MLTI laptops that the school gets I suggested that instead of paying for laptops that had much more power than we would use. I suggest that we get chromebooks because they're cheap and they are optimized for google drive.

Being involved in issues is important. Solving community issues doesn't only benefit you but your community. Suggesting the chrome books over the mac books was important to me because we don't use nearly all the power of the mac books and the chrome books are optimized for what we use our computers for.
