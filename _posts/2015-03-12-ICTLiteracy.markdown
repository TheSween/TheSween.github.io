Being in computer repair we donâ€™t always have the manual for all the computers or equipment we have so we need to use the internet to find the manuals. Searching manufacturers websites for motherboard manuals to figure out beep codes is a common thing I do. Also whenever I get stuck I google my problem and most of the time I find similar problems and they provide a solution. Being able to utilize a search engine and find what you need is a very important skill to have.

This will help me in the future if I need to find information. Google has many ways you can enter information and manipulate it to get different results. Knowing how the algorithms works and how to manipulate them to find what I need is a very important skill in any job field.
