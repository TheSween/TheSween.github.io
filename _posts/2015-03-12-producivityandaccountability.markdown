My biggest goal I have achieved was my goal to lose weight. I started out at 260lb and dropped down to 220lb. This was a hard goal to achieve I had to set a bunch of small goals to record my progress. I had to research supplements and the best way to build muscles and lose fat. Losing weight was the hardest but most rewarding thing I have done.
