I learned about health literacy in my 9th grade health class. We studied and discussed many different types of health issues. We got assigned to research a certain health issue. My friend and I Jacob Barney had to research about strep throat and inform our class about this health issue. People are more likely to get strep throat by hanging around a lot of people, kids in schools tend to get it more often.

It is important to be able to identify common sickness to know when you or other will need medical attention. Also it is important to know what can cause them to avoid them and be healthy.
