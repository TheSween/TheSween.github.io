When I was younger my parents took me and my sister on a trip to Boston aquarium. We took
the northeastern train. Once we arrived in Boston we went straight to the aquarium which was
right on the water I remember seeing tons of jellyfish. My favorite part about the aquarium was
the penguins. I have always liked penguins, I donâ€™t know why penguins always have interested
me.
