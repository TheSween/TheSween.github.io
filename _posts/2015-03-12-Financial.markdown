This summer when i worked at Dunkinâ€™ Donuts I worked about 40 hours a week and made about two hundred dollars a week. I would put one hundred a week in the bank no matter what and the rest I used for gas and stuff I needed. I saved about one thousand dollars overall to use towards stuff like tires for my car and other financial needs.

Working at Dunkin' Donuts taught me to save money and that if you want money you need to work hard for it. Working taught me the true value of a dollar and working fast food for $7.50 and hour opened my eyes.
